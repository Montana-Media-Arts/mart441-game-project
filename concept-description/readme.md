# Concept Description and Basic Gameplay

Our game is a fighting one based on the ability for multiple players to login and compete against each other. Our basic gameplay is based off of wasd direcitons and can perhaps be developed differently later for mobile.
Four pixel-based players of differing colors will be placed into the "arena" as they enter the game. Extra players will either play on a different stage or have to wait in a queue until they are allowed in.
We have several ideas for what type of fighting game we could make. One idea was a giant pillow-fight. Another was the generic jump/kick/punch that we were planning on doing. It would include projectile powerups that could be thrown at other players.
We also toyed with the idea of a rotating screen vs a scrolling screen vs. a looping screen.
