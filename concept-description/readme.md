# Concept Description and Basic Gameplay

Our game is a fighting one based on the ability for multiple players to login and compete against each other. Our basic gameplay is based off of wasd direcitons and can perhaps be developed differently later for mobile.
Four pixel-based players of differing colors will be placed into the "arena" as they enter the game. Extra players will either play on a different stage or have to wait in a queue until they are allowed in.
We have several ideas for what type of fighting game we could make. One idea was a giant pillow-fight. Another was the generic jump/kick/punch that we were planning on doing. It would include projectile powerups that could be thrown at other players.
We also toyed with the idea of a rotating screen vs a scrolling screen vs. a looping screen.

**Note:** I'm not sure what we've decided for each of these things, so I put together a partial pros/cons list. If we've actually decided on something, we can ~~strike out~~ the things we don't want.

##Pros/Cons:
Here are some Pros/Cons for each:

### Multi-Player handling:
How will we handle more than one player?
#### New stages:
#####Pros:
- Will allow players to enter the game right away.
- May allow players that are less experienced with the game to enter with other players who are inexperienced.
- May allow players to play with others in similar timezones.
#####Cons:
- May take more coding and more memory to put together
- May be difficult to coordinate.
#### Queue:
#####Pros:
- It is unnecessary to make other stages.
- It doesn't require as much memory or RAM.
- Once someone dies (or is KO'd) they have a long "timeout" before they can re-join.
#####Cons:
- Players may have to wait a long time before being able to play.
- Players may drop out if they have to wait for a while.

### Gameplay:
How will we control the players?

#### WASD - directional (computer-first):
#####Pros:
- It is much eaiser to control the characters in WASD.
- Allows for other keys to be used to do other things like shoot and switch weapons (if needed).
- Leaves the right hand free if we want to use the mouse
for aiming, etc.
- Mobile problem may be solved using a digital joystick.
#####Cons:
- Becomes a pain in the neck if we want to transfer it to mobile later.
- People have to have a keyboard to play.

#### Mouse and Click (phone-first):
#####Pros:
- Will make it easier to convert to phones later.
- Mobile devices are more wide-spread, meaning it will be more convenient for players to join, and they can play anywhere they want.
#####Cons:
- The movements and strikes may be slightly more difficult to control than they woud be with keystrokes.
- Less options if you want more than striking.

### Screen Layout:
What will our basic stage be like?

#### Rotating screen:
#####Pros:
- Players have control over more surface area.
- It's a creative solution to having a limited screen that doesn't scroll or loop.
- Adds another dimension to fighting by promoting more tactics and forcing the players to think in multiple directions.
- It adds a certain charm and difficulty to the game to have to worry about other players attacking from above or the sides.
- Multiple sides of "platforms" or other objects can be utilized as shields or as places to hide behind.
#####Cons:
- May be confusing for players.
- May be difficult to code for individual control (and perspective).
- May be confusing for people just entering.

#### Scrolling Screen:
#####Pros:
-
#####Cons:
-

#### Looping Screen:
#####Pros:
-
#####Cons:
-
