Level ideas:
-Lets say that we choose ranged abilities as a way to attack. Adding obsticles that can block attack but some can only be used one way otherwise they are trapped, this is an advantage to those who work the map in their favor.

-Mario type tunnels, which helps with mobility, but could be a disadvantage to a player if another player camps that one tunnel. So what if the tunnels indecated if beinging used by a player that way someone can tell if being chased, slight delay between tunnels to give a sense of travel, as well as time to react.

-A map that is dangerous to the play to give more difficulty to the game, that way the map isnt to anyones favor, can be selected as a setting opion.
